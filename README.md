# How to Train YOLO11 Object Detection on a Custom Dataset

This notebook provides a step-by-step guide to training the YOLO11 object detection model on a custom dataset. YOLO11 is an advanced version of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) series, offering significant improvements in accuracy, speed, and efficiency.

## Overview

YOLO11 incorporates:
- Enhanced architectural designs for better feature extraction.
- Optimized training methods to improve accuracy.
- Lightweight models with 22% fewer parameters compared to YOLOv8m, while achieving superior performance.

## Description

The notebook is designed for users who want to train YOLO11 models for their specific object detection tasks. It explains how to:
1. Prepare and preprocess a custom dataset.
2. Configure YOLO11 settings for training.
3. Train the model effectively to achieve high mean Average Precision (mAP) scores.

YOLO11 is available in multiple sizes, ranging from lightweight models for resource-constrained environments to larger models optimized for high accuracy. Its versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from real-time detection on edge devices to complex tasks requiring robust performance.
